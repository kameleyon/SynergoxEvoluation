```

2. Create a new Botpress instance:
```bash
botpress init
cd your-bot-name
```

3. Configure Environment Variables:
Create a `.env` file with the following configuration:
```ini
BOTPRESS_PORT=3001                  # Change the port number if needed
BOTPRESS_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0        # To allow external access if needed
BOTPRESS_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@synergox.com
BOTPRESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword
BOTPRESS_DB=sqlite                  # You can switch to PostgreSQL if you prefer
BOTPRESS_ENV=production             # Set to 'development' for development purposes
```

4. Start Botpress:
```bash
botpress start
```

Access the Botpress Admin Panel at http://localhost:3001/admin using the credentials from your .env file.
